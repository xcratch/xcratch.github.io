# What is Xcratch

[Xcratch](https://xcratch.github.io/) is a mod application of [Scratch3 by MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to play with user-made extensions easily.

## Features

### Online Installation and Auto-loading on demand

You can install and use user-made extensions from the web. Once you make a project with extended blocks, the project can be opened on Xcratch without installing required extensions by user.

### Built-in Web Bluetooth API

You don't need to run [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/microbit) to play with micro:bit or BLE devices when your browser is Chrome, Edge or 'Web Bluetooth API' supporting one (the browser in Chromebook, [Scrub](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/scrub-web-browser/id1569777095) in iPad, like that).

### Can be Used Offline

The Xcratch editor is a PWA (Progressive Web Apps), which means that once you access it, you can use it without any further Internet communication. You can also install it on your local machine if necessary.

There is two way to open project directly.
